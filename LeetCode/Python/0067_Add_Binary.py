# LeetCode
# Problem 67: Add Binary
# https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary

# Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

# Example 1:
# Input: a = "11", b = "1"
# Output: "100"

# Example 2:
# Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
# Output: "10101"
 
# Constraints:
# 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
# a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
# Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        num_a = int(a, 2)
        num_b = int(b, 2)
        num_bin = bin(num_a + num_b)
        return str(num_bin.replace("0b", ""))
